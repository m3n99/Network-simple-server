# Network-simple-server

Implement a simple but a complete web server in python listening on port 7000. The user types in the browser something like http://localhost:7000/1 or http://localhost:7000/2 or http://localhost:7000/3
The program should check
if the request is /1 then it should show a simple webpage with
1- “ENCS436 Webserver” in the title
2- Your names and IDs in Bold
3- “Welcome to our course Computer Networks” (part of the phrase is in Green)
4- The IP and port number of the client
if the request is /2 then the server should send an html page with Content-Type: text/html. You can use any html file.
if the request is /3 then the server should send a jpg image with Content-Type: image/jpeg. You can use any image.
The program should print the HTTP request on the terminal window (command line window).
Provide screenshots of the browser (http://ipaddress1:7000/1 and 2 and 3) on the same computer and from a different computer or phone.
Provide also a screenshot of the HTTP request.
